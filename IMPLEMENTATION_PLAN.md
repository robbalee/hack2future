# Insurance Fraud Detection System - Incremental Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Build a cloud-native insurance claims fraud detection system using Azure services, Python Flask, and AI/ML components for automated fraud assessment. **Building incrementally on existing Flask demo.**

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation âœ…
- **Flask Application**: Basic web app with claim submission
- **File Upload**: PDF and image upload functionality
- **Local Storage**: JSON-based claim storage in `claims_data/`
- **Admin Dashboard**: Basic claims listing and management
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS-based responsive interface
- **Schemas**: JSON schemas for various claim documents

### Architecture Overview
```
Current: Web UI â†’ Flask App â†’ Local Files
Target:  Web UI â†’ Flask App â†’ Azure Services â†’ AI/ML â†’ Monitoring
```

## Current Progress âœ…

### Infrastructure Setup Complete (June 6, 2025)
- **Terraform Configuration**: Successfully created and configured Terraform files for Azure
- **Remote State Management**: ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL: Always use remote state from Azure Storage**
  - Backend Configuration:
    ```hcl
    terraform {
      backend "azurerm" {
        resource_group_name  = "hack2future"
        storage_account_name = "secondstorageeu"
        container_name       = "tfstate"
        key                  = "insurance-fraud-detection.tfstate"
      }
    }
    ```
- **Resource Import**: All existing Azure resources imported into Terraform state:
  - âœ… Resource Group: `hack2future` (East US)
  - âœ… App Service Plan: `ASP-hack2future-a7e2` (B2 Windows)
  - âœ… Web App: `hack2future` (.NET 8.0 â†’ to be migrated to Python)
  - âœ… Storage Account 1: `documentstoreeu` (Premium ZRS)
  - âœ… Storage Account 2: `secondstorageeu` (Standard RAGRS)
  - âœ… Cosmos DB: `insurance-fraud-db-dev` with database `insurance-claims-db`
  - âœ… Cosmos Containers: `claims` and `events` (with proper partition keys)
  - âœ… Cognitive Services: `Hack2F` (OpenAI S0), `pawel1fraud` (General Cognitive Services)
- **Remote State**: Terraform state successfully configured to use Azure Storage backend
- **State File**: Located at `secondstorageeu/tfstate/insurance-fraud-detection.tfstate`

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY Remote State Protocol
**Before ANY Terraform operation, ALWAYS:**
1. `cd /workspaces/hack2future/demo/terraform`
2. `terraform init` - Connect to remote backend
3. `terraform refresh` - Sync with actual Azure resources  
4. `terraform show` - Verify current state matches expectations
5. Never use `terraform destroy` or start from scratch
6. Always plan before apply: `terraform plan` then `terraform apply`

### ðŸŽ¯ **Resource Dependency Analysis**
**Independent Cognitive Services** (No networking dependencies):
- `azurerm_cognitive_account.custom_vision_training` âœ… Standalone
- `azurerm_cognitive_account.custom_vision_prediction` âœ… Standalone  
- `azurerm_cognitive_account.fraud_detection` âœ… Standalone

**Networking Resources** (Only used by Application Gateway):
- `azurerm_virtual_network.main` â†’ Only referenced by `azurerm_subnet.internal`
- `azurerm_subnet.internal` â†’ Only referenced by Application Gateway
- `azurerm_public_ip.main` â†’ Only referenced by Application Gateway

**âœ… CONCLUSION**: Cognitive Services are completely independent of networking resources and can be deployed separately.

## Incremental Development Rules

### Development Principles
1. **Always keep the app working**: Each increment should maintain functionality
2. **Test early and often**: Test each feature as it's added
3. **Feature flags**: Use configuration to enable/disable new features
4. **Fallback mechanisms**: Always have a backup plan if cloud services fail
5. **Local development**: Ensure the app works locally without cloud dependencies

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration tests**: Test cloud service integrations
- **Manual testing**: Test UI and workflows after each increment
- **Performance testing**: Monitor performance impact of each change

### Deployment Strategy
- **Local development**: All features work locally first
- **Staging environment**: Test cloud integrations
- **Production deployment**: Only after thorough testing

## Implementation Timeline (Revised)

| Week | Phase | Key Activities | Milestone |
|------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | Foundation | Code refactoring, basic fraud detection | Enhanced local app |
| 2 | Cloud Integration | Azure setup, DB migration, blob storage | Hybrid local/cloud |
| 3 | AI Integration | Document processing, enhanced fraud detection | AI-powered features |
| 4 | Monitoring | App Insights, performance, security | Production-ready |
| 5 | Serverless | Azure Functions, automated workflows | Scalable architecture |
| 6+ | Advanced | Analytics, ML pipeline, APIs | Complete system |

## Step-by-Step Development Process

### For Each Increment:
1. **Plan**: Define specific goals and success criteria
2. **Develop**: Implement feature locally first
3. **Test**: Thoroughly test the new functionality
4. **Integrate**: Add cloud components if needed
5. **Deploy**: Update staging/production
6. **Verify**: Confirm everything works end-to-end
7. **Document**: Update documentation and move to next step

This approach ensures we have a working system at each step and can debug issues incrementally rather than trying to solve everything at once.
